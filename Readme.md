# edgeR + multiMiR Pipeline

This repository contains an R workflow for performing **differential expression analysis** of small RNAs (e.g., miRNAs) using **edgeR**, followed by retrieval of **validated miRNA targets** with the [multiMiR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multiMiR/) package.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Reads count data and experimental conditions.  
- Performs **differential expression analysis** using `edgeR`.  
- Extracts top differentially expressed miRNAs.  
- Retrieves **validated miRNA targets** from the multiMiR database.  
- Outputs results for downstream biological interpretation.  

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

- [edgeR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)  
- [multiMiR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multiMiR/)  

To install them:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}

# Bioconductor package
BiocManager::install("edgeR")

# CRAN package
install.packages("multiMiR")
````

---

## ðŸ“‚ Input Files

The pipeline requires:

1. **Counts table** (`counts_table.tsv`) â€“ matrix of raw read counts (genes/miRNAs as rows, samples as columns).
2. **Strains/condition factor** (`strains_factor.tsv`) â€“ metadata describing sample groups.

ðŸ‘‰ Example datasets are included with the `multiMiR` package (`extdata/`).

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the script:

```r
source("edgeR_multiMiR_pipeline.R")
```

This will:

1. Load the count data and experimental design.
2. Perform normalization, dispersion estimation, and differential expression analysis with edgeR.
3. Extract the **top 10 differentially expressed miRNAs**.
4. Query multiMiR for validated targets in mouse (`org = "mmu"`).

---

## ðŸ“Š Output

* **Top 10 DE miRNAs** are printed in the console.
* **multiMiR target results** are displayed (and can be saved).

Example console output:

```
âœ… Top 10 differentially expressed miRNAs:
[1] "mmu-miR-21a-5p" "mmu-miR-155-5p" "mmu-miR-34a-5p" ...

âœ… multiMiR results retrieved:
       mature_mirna_id target_symbol database
1       mmu-miR-21a-5p          PTEN    miRTarBase
2       mmu-miR-155-5p           SOCS1  TarBase
...
```

---

## ðŸ§¬ Customization

* Change `org = "mmu"` to another organism (e.g., `"hsa"` for human).
* Adjust the number of top DE miRNAs (`[1:10]`) as needed.
* Save results with:

```r
write.csv(p_val_DE_edgeR$table, "DE_miRNAs_edgeR.csv")
write.csv(multimir_results@data, "multiMiR_targets.csv")
```
